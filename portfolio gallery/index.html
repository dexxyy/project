                        HTML (stands for Hypertext Markup Language) is a computer language that makes up most web pages and online
                        applications.
                        A hypertext is a text that is used to reference other pieces of text, while a markup language is a series of
                        markings
                        that tells web servers the style and structure of a document.

                        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This
                        article explains what CSS is with a simple syntax example and also covers some key terms about the language.

                        Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It has evolved from
                        humble beginnings to power a large share of today’s digital world, by providing the reliable platform upon which many
                        services and applications are built. New, innovative products and digital services designed for the future continue to
                        rely on Java, as well.

                        JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every
                        time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely
                        content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that
                        JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which
                        (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.
