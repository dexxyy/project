                        HTML (stands for Hypertext Markup Language) is a computer language that makes up most web pages and online applications.
                        A hypertext is a text that is used to reference other pieces of text, while a markup language is a series of markings
                        that tells web servers the style and structure of a document. <br>
                        HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, allows web users to create and structure sections, paragraphs, and links using
                        elements, tags, and attributes. However, it’s worth noting that HTML is not considered a programming language as it
                        can’t create dynamic functionality.

                        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This
                        article explains what CSS is with a simple syntax example and also covers some key terms about the language.
                        <br>
                        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
                        CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
                        CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
                        External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

                        JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every
                        time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely
                        content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that
                        JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which
                        (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area. <br>
                        JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate
                        images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines
                        of JavaScript code.)

                        Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built
                        in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application
                        Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's
                        simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python
                        supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the
                        extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be
                        freely distributed.

                        PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language
                        that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML. <br>
                        It is powerful enough to be at the core of the biggest blogging system on the web (WordPress)!
                        It is deep enough to run large social networks!
                        It is also easy enough to be a beginner's first server side language!

                        Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It has evolved from
                        humble beginnings to power a large share of today’s digital world, by providing the reliable platform upon which many
                        services and applications are built. New, innovative products and digital services designed for the future continue to
                        rely on Java, as well. <br>
                        While most modern Java applications combine the Java runtime and application together, there are still many applications
                        and even some websites that will not function unless you have a desktop Java installed. Java.com, this website, is
                        intended for consumers who may still require Java for their desktop applications – specifically applications targeting
                        Java 8. Developers as well as users that would like to learn Java programming should visit the dev.java website instead
                        and business users should visit oracle.com/java for more information.
